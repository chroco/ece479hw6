lright I noticed a few things you can try. 
So, on line 39 and 53, change the count to 41 and 31. These are the number of door and window images there are to loop through and add. 
on line 27, change validation_size to 1. 
on line 36, 78, 84, and 85 change the 1800 to 72. This should be the total number of images.
ok
Thank you. Stupid python
on line 148 and 149, change training_epochs to 7 and batch_size to 10.
also, are you doing any preprocessing? because all the images need to be the same size for this to work. Currently the code assumes the images are 50x50 pixels
wow what a picky algorithm
i have not done any preprocessing yet
i will preprocess using canny-hough but i guess there is a bit more too
i was just trying to get the script to run
